## Before the sprint
Before we started the sprint we sat down with my stakeholders to indicate what we wanted to do next, as I wanted to make another functionality not knowing we didn't have that much time left my stakeholders had stated that it would maybe be a better idea to start fixing the bugs that are currenly still in the application and after that maybe work further on the last functionallity that they had in mind. They were pretty confident that I could work on this last functionality in this sprint, as it didn't really matter to them if it would be actually in the prototype or just something like a design. As long as I would do research on it and work it out in some sort of way they would be really satisfied. But first I started fixing the bugs that were still in the application which I will elaborate more in the following paragraphs.
