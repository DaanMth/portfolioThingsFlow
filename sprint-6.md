## Before the sprint
When starting this sprint there were a few things that had to be done before I could go back to making more functionalities in my prototype. My stakeholders missed a few things in the figma design from which they really wanted to see the functionality. So I put these all in a list and put this on the number one priority to do, as this wasn't as much of work I took in mind that this would only take about one to two days. We also concluded last retrospective that I was gonna make a functionality to save the lists on the playground page and view the lists on the list page.  We set on this functionality for this sprint as I had made the error handling in the design and the switch case as well, and these two functionalities were pretty hard to do in just one sprint so we settled on this one. This was a pretty big task to do and we thought that this would take the whole sprint after finishing the design. 

## Finishing and improving the designs in Figma
There were two big things that the stakeholders were missing, the first thing that they missed was how the switch case would work. Beforehand you would just click on the switch case and after that on a end-component and it would just appear but it wasn't clear for the stakeholders how this would work. So I improved this by making a modal inside the switch case component where you can manually choose how many cases you want and what kind of statement there should be in there. You can test the switch case right here; [Switch case](https://www.figma.com/proto/RIRckga4ygXjIpYMYyj278/ThingsFlow?node-id=438%3A3569&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=425%3A3202&show-proto-sidebar=1)

Another thing that they were missing were the error logs, at first I had made a error by bordering the specific component in which an error occured. But they wanted to see how it would look inside and they also wanted to see a specific page were the logging was made. So I made a modal when clicking on the component that went wrong and when you click on the error notification you get to see what went wrong in as an error log, you can try it out here; [Error logging](https://www.figma.com/proto/RIRckga4ygXjIpYMYyj278/ThingsFlow?node-id=463%3A3541&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=425%3A3202&show-proto-sidebar=1).

I also made a new icon you can press to see the logging of the flow, when pressing on it you get to see the page where the logging of the flow is shown. Here you can see information about the flow when it has ran such as time that it took, when it ran, and some specific details. You can try it out here; [Logging](https://www.figma.com/proto/RIRckga4ygXjIpYMYyj278/ThingsFlow?node-id=610%3A3079&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=425%3A3202&show-proto-sidebar=1)
