## The laws

When first making the design in Figma I made it based on comparing to other flow tools and bij using the color palet from the ThingsDB GUI of the backend. But I wanted to research if there were any psychological reasonings behind certain ways of making a project. That's why I made a research document on [the laws of UX](uploads/b641b0df00c96b4e92715680b5628d7e/The_laws_of_UX.pdf), this gave me a much better insight on designing with underlying meaning and the best practice way to make certain designs. I also made another document because I found more about [best practices in UX designing](uploads/88eb7f34f8cb1ac93ee7b99ab7cb0794/UXBestPractice.pdf), so I wanted to document this as well. 
<br>Both these documents really gave me a better understanding on UX designing and really helped me this internship making and designing with a purpose. I really think the user experience got better with these documents and this will definitely help me in the future as well

## Researching the platform
Because I didn't really have an understanding of the back-end yet I wanted to make a [research document](uploads/bcceeb817e923ca09873eb76fe138cf9/Research_ThingsDB.pdf) on this as well, where I'd figure out how to work with ThingsDB and along the way write down the stuff that I encounter, this really helped me get to know the platform better and while writing down how to set it up it alsof gave me a reminder on how to do so if I would forget how to. In this document I have written down all the specific things that is provided in ThingsDB and I also tested specific functionalities to see if I got the hang of it. 


## Is it possible?
After I got the hang of ThingsDB itself I wanted to find out if it is even possible to make a flow tool on top of ThingsDB, this was a very important question to ask because if this came out as negative I would have to switch up my whole project and make a different one. Because my stakeholder was so positive it was possible it gave me a confidence boost that it would be, and so it didn't stress me out a lot that it could be possible that it wouldn't work. In the [research document](uploads/fbf1a80ca6cce6a318288d58c962dd0c/Is_it_possible_to_make_a_Flow_tool_by_using_ThingsDB.pdf) I did several researches so I could reassure that it is indeed possible to make a flow tool on top of ThingsDB.
