## Other way of working
For this sprint I had the idea that I wouldn't be making a lot of research documents, I wanted to spend most of my time making a prototype and researching how I wanted to make this work. Most of my time went into designing this flow tool so I didn't have a lot of time for documenting other research. I made one document, for the returning arrows 

## Baby steps of the Flow Tool
This sprint I gave myself time to make a prototype, I used WebStorm to make a React front-end. In which I started designing my flow tool based on the Figma designs that I've made, this was very useful as I already knew where things were supposed to be so this made me work a lot more goal oriented. When I was done with my design I first asked feedback from my stakeholder.
