## The birth of an internship

For the first sprint I found it important to get to know the company better, I spent most of my time getting more acquainted with my coworkers and stakeholders. I did this by making a [survey](uploads/fe6bfe46eb91219766094d8bedc8c238/Vragenlijst_Cesbit.pdf) little  for the company in which I asked questions about how the internship would go and more in depth questions about the project that I will be making. This gave me a much better insight and a more structured way of looking at my internship, it was also a fun way to get to know eachother.

I also started making a [research document](uploads/5b4dc45be38e584e31897731814bff68/Werking_Flow.pdf) on how the flow should work, I wanted to put this down on paper so it was clear for everyone included what I was supposed to make and how the things I will be making should work. I put this down together with Jeroen as he had more knowledge about the functionalities and a pretty clear idea on how he wanted it to look. 

After that I wanted to research the 'rivals' and what their pro's and cons were. One of the biggest flow tools application is Dovetail, so I made a [research document](uploads/ca4738ea9d65640fcd042b8e875d8b1e/Research_Document_Dovetail_ENG.pdf) for this studying their ways and trying to figure out where their disadvantages layed.

I also started with my [project plan](uploads/73b496acd3f468691ddc125976de4f1e/Projectplan_Daan_Matheeuwsen_V2.pdf), after I had done a few assignments I had made for myself and having a Q&A with my stakeholders I had a good idea on what I had to make for my project at the company, so I spent the majority of this sprint making the project plan and having conversations with my stakeholders at the company and the tutor supervisor to see the project was also alligned with what the project owners and the school expected from me, after a lot of feedback I had finished this and I could go on with the next part of the project.
