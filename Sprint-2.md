## Other way of working
For this sprint I had the idea that I wouldn't be making a lot of research documents, I wanted to spend most of my time making a prototype and researching how I wanted to make this work. Most of my time went into designing this flow tool so I didn't have a lot of time for documenting other research. I made one document, for the returning arrows
