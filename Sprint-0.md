## The birth of an internship

For the first sprint I found it important to get to know the company better, I spent most of my time getting more acquainted with my coworkers and stakeholders. I did this by making a [survey](uploads/fe6bfe46eb91219766094d8bedc8c238/Vragenlijst_Cesbit.pdf) little  for the company in which I asked questions about how the internship would go and more in depth questions about the project that I will be making. This gave me a much better insight and a more structured way of looking at my internship, it was also a fun way to get to know eachother.

I also started making a [research document](uploads/5b4dc45be38e584e31897731814bff68/Werking_Flow.pdf) on how the flow should work, I wanted to put this down on paper so it was clear for everyone included what I was supposed to make and how the things I will be making should work. I put this down together with Jeroen as he had more knowledge about the functionalities and a pretty clear idea on how he wanted it to look. 

After that I wanted to research the 'rivals' and what their pro's and cons were. One of the biggest flow tools application is Dovetail, so I made a [research document](uploads/ca4738ea9d65640fcd042b8e875d8b1e/Research_Document_Dovetail_ENG.pdf) for this studying their ways and trying to figure out where their disadvantages layed.
