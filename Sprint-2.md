## Other way of working
For this sprint I had the idea that I wouldn't be making a lot of research documents, I wanted to spend most of my time making a prototype and researching how I wanted to make this work. Most of my time went into designing this flow tool so I didn't have a lot of time for documenting other research. I made one document, for the returning arrows 

## Baby steps of the Flow Tool
This sprint I gave myself time to make a prototype, I used WebStorm to make a React front-end. In which I started designing my flow tool based on the Figma designs that I've made, this was very useful as I already knew where things were supposed to be so this made me work a lot more goal oriented. When I was done with my design I first asked feedback from my stakeholder. They were very pleased with how everything looked. But they were kind of debating if they wanted to have the sidebar underneath the board, as you would probably need a lot of room for the flow. But as I did some research on UX design I could say that this wasn't really the best way of a flow tool to look and they agreed to go further with the sidebar as it is.

Then I wanted to add the functionality that you could drag the components inside the board, and that it would make a new list and it would showcase on the board. After some trial and error with various drag and drop libraries I had managed to make a drag and drop functionality.

Now that I had this functionality I wanted to see if I could make this connect with the back-end in any kind of way. My first idea was to give each component a number and to make a sort of calculation between the components with a procedure in the backend, you can read this back in ___. I made this work as well as you can see down below.
