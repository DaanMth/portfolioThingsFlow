## Adding actual functionalities 
When I had figured out the multiplying application I thought it was time to make some components that could talk to eachother that actually could be used for the actual ThingsFlow application. So I started tinkering what could be a convenient route to make for this sprint that was achievable but still very cool to make. After some sketching and conversations with my stakeholders I came up with a 3 step flow that converts a JSON file to a [DutyCalls](uploads/7188a61e3307e8a5105d172f7000c0eb/DutyCalls.pdf) mail. I made a video on the functionality to showcase it better, you can find the video by clicking on the link below; https://youtu.be/gw4G_18yKQ8
