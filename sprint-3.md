## Continuing the good prototyping spirit
Because the prototyping part was going pretty well I wanted to continue working on this. <br>
First of all I fixed the design a little bit with the feedback I got, I made the header and I fixed the look of the components that are visible on the board.<br> Then I wanted to showcase that you could make a working flow, in which the components talk with eachother and actually send their data to eachother and manipulate it the way it says it should. I wanted to do this because I wanted to know myself how this could work as I had no idea yet how I wanted to do this part. So I started sketching ways it could be possible on a notepad. After I did some tinkering and sketching I thought the easiest way to make this was to make a calculator, with each component having its own characteristic such as subtract, divide, multiply and sum. So I removed all the components from the sidebar that I already had and made a list of objects in the backend that could be used to for this idea I had in mind. This wasn't that easy of a task but because I had already done some sketching and brainstorming before this really helped me with the set-up of the back-end and front-end

Then I needed to figure out a way to let the components that you drag in talk to eachother, this was a big problem. I had tried many ways to do this, but it kept giving me more and more errors. I wanted to fix this myself as I thought I was super close to the solution and just needed to fix one more error to solve the problem that I had so I kept trying and trying but I kept digging a deeper hole for myself. Eventually my stakeholder noticed that I didn't really make progress the way I wanted to, as I verbally told them that I kept having errors. So he gave me the advice that I should just ask if I really d
