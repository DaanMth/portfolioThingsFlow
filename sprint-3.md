## Continuing the good prototyping spirit
Because the prototyping part was going pretty well I wanted to continue working on this. <br>
First of all I fixed the design a little bit with the feedback I got, I made the header and I fixed the look of the components that are visible on the board. <br> Then I wanted to showcase that you could make a working flow, in which the components talk with eachother and actually send their data to eachother and manipulate it the way it says it should. I thought the easiest way to make this was to make a calculator, with each component having its own characteristic such as subtract, divide, multiply and sum. So I removed all the components from the sidebar that I already had and made a list of objects in the backend that could be used to for this idea I had in mind.
