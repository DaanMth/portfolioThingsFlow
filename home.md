## Introduction of me and the internship

I am Daan Matheeuwsen, currently doing an internship for Cesbit.

Before I tell you more about my internship, I would like to introduce myself. I am 20 years old and in my fifth semester studying HBO-ICT at the Fontys in Eindhoven. In the second and third semesters, I followed the Software course, and in the fourth semester, I followed the Creative-Technology course. During this course, we made some nifty projects, such as an automated kitchen that responds to hand movements. We also designed an innovative coin system for festivals. This semester made me realize that I enjoy the creative and designing part of ICT, and I wanted to do something that leans more in those ways for my internship.

Luckily a mutual acquaintance introduced me to Cesbit. After an initial call, they invited me over to chat about the project and get to know each other. Both ends thought it would be a good idea to work together on this project. They had a project where I could be creative and learn more about its infrastructure and software.

Cesbit recently released ThingsDB, an object-oriented database with event-driven features that allow developers to store things in intuitive ways. It’s a platform/product that combines the power of flexible data storage, backendless data serving, pub/sub functionality, and business rules implementation into a single powerful toolbox. It is also a very highly available and scalable backend and database.

They saw an opportunity to make a flow-tool on top of this database as an alternative to the more traditional and complex available tools. For Cesbit having a graphical interface built on top of ThingsDB is also a great way to introduce ThingsDB.

My first task in this project is to figure out if it is possible to use ThingsDB as a backend for a flow tool. If so, the next step is to design this tool and, if time permits create a working prototype.

Rik and Jeroen noticed quickly that I am a very creative person, and they give me a lot of freedom on this project. They also enjoy learning from me as I learn from them as they are more focused on making the software and ensuring reliability and scalability.

Cesbit is keen on making the best products. Their products are robust and scalable. They don’t believe in fixed deadlines, so the employees don’t have to feel pressured to finish something at a specific time. For me, this took some getting used to as my study focuses on delivering on time.

Furthermore, the people who work at cesbit are enthusiastic about what they make and passionate about what they do. Because of this, they are also very eager to help you out when needed; they don’t believe in stupid questions and will always be open to help when needed.
